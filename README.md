# AI-water-pollution-detection
These are the steps that I followed while creating this project

Data Collection: Gather water quality data from various sources, including sensors( turbidity, conductivity, and temperature) and microcontroller(ESP32)

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise, missing values, and outliers.

Machine Learning Models: I have used Linear Regression algorithms to analyze the data and detect pollution trends.

Real-time Monitoring: Implement a real-time monitoring system that continuously collects and analyzes data to provide up-to-date information on water quality.

Pollution Prediction: Use AI models to predict future pollution levels based on historical data and environmental factors.

Use the data for Future to evaluate the status of the river
